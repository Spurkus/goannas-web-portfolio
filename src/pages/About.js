    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>Hi I'm Anna although on all my profiles I go by Goanna. I'm heading into my second year
      of the integrated Bachelor of Computer Science and Master of Cyber Security at UQ, majoring in 
      Cyber Security.
    </p>
    <p>
    Whilst I am interested in the Cyber Security environment, I also have an interest in software development so
    I'm looking to further my general programming skills through a series of projects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>this website, learning front-end web development</li>
      <li>a discord bot to play around with certain commands and possible API calls</li>
      <li>a minecraft mod because I enjoy playing, and I'm wishing to consolidate my Java knowledge</li>
      <li>and potentially more in the future</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    </>
    )
