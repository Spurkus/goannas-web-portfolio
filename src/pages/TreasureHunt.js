        <h2>Your task:</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>1. Find a secret button, located on a secret page, and there will be a reward for you</p>
        <p>
          2. The URL to access the secret page will be a randomly generated combo of letters/numbers
          so that everyone looking at the source code can't cheat. Yes I see you ðŸ‘€
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            <b>Example</b> format of a URL could be:
            https://goannas-web-portfolio.vercel.app/SPNTi5u37l
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Clues about this combo of letters/numbers are spread throughout my website, happy
          hunting!!
        </p>
        <p>
          *NOTE* Having the console open is encouraged. Although if you wanna cheat my code, check
          out the challenge section below.

          <h2>Vulnerabilities that I decided to make into challenges:</h2>
          <p>
            Challenge 1: don't look for any clues. Instead read source code and type something into
            the console to find the secret string.
          </p>
          <p>
            Challenge 2: don't look for any clues and also don't type anything into the console.
            Instead read source code and modify cookies to access reward.
          </p>

          <p>
            You've found a clue!! Reload the page to make sure the below info is updated (right now

          </p>
          <p>
            The first 2 letters are {localStorage.getItem("randomString")[0]} &{" "}
