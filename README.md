# My web portfolio

A portfolio to showcase some projects I will hopefully make, including:
- this web app
- a discord bot
- a minecraft mod
- and maybe more!

# To do 
- Spice up about page & treasure hunt page (investigate Tailwind CSS) since no one likes looking at big chunks of text
- Fix styling of buttons on treasure hunt page
- Screen shots from projects once completed
- Finalise the 'reward' since its pretty mid at the moment
- Fix coder icon on home page?
- When I learn better ways of hiding info in webpages I should do that to make it more difficult
