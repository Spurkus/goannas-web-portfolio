# My web portfolio

A portfolio to showcase some projects I will hopefully make, including:
- this web app
- a discord bot
- a minecraft mod
- and maybe more!

# To do 
- Spice up about page (investigate Tailwind CSS), maybe include link to my goodreads idk
- Interactiveness on projects page & screen shots from projects once completed
- Different icon for home page, one that fits colours better
